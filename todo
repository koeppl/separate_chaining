the iterator can be made fully functional 

make elements private in hash table


contestants:
- sparse map from google
- https://github.com/Tessil/sparse-map
- bonsai hash tables

describe AVX2 + compact hashing with an example

show that with `uint_t` approach, hashing 40, 48-bits, etc., is possible

use data structure in LZ78 computation

implement a bonsai trie data structure with this hash table

compare memory overhead of this hash table with a hash table using open addressing, since we store bucket sizes + bucket pointers
Which max-load-factor is needed to compensate the open addressing leaving empty spots?
